 ## Core Objectives & Features -
üîó Connect: At OpenDenzent, we strive to connect the real world with the web3 world by providing a seamless funding and support experience to scientific projects, researchers, and non-profit organizations. We act as a bridge between these entities, enabling them to receive the necessary funds and support without any hassle.
üôè Support: OpenDenzent's core objective is to assist scientific research projects by utilizing blockchain technology. By doing so, we offer an improved solution to the issues associated with conventional crowdfunding and donation platforms currently available on web2. Our goal is to provide a better approach that supports real-world science research projects.
üíµ Reward: (Upcoming) Exclusive NFTs: Donors could receive exclusive NFTs that represent their contributions to specific research projects. These NFTs could be minted on a blockchain and serve as a digital proof of ownership and contribution.
üîî Update: With the help of Push-Protocol , users are notified whenever there is any update from the project, Donators, or organizations after they got funding.
üéØGOAL: Our Ultimate Goal is to connect & support people using blockchain in such a way that they can leverage the technology and bring some positive changes in the world.


## Main features

* User-friendly interface: OpenDenzent is designed to be accessible and user-friendly, even for those without technical expertise.

## Problems We Are Solving
* Lack of transparency: Traditional funding models often lack transparency, making it difficult for donors to track how their funds are being used and for researchers to demonstrate the impact of their research projects.
* Intermediaries: Traditional funding models involve intermediaries such as funding agencies, academic institutions, and private foundations, which can add unnecessary bureaucracy and costs to the funding process.
* Limited funding opportunities: Many promising research projects struggle to obtain the resources they need to succeed due to limited funding opportunities or eligibility criteria.
* Limited access to funding: Traditional funding models can also be exclusive, with certain research topics or groups receiving more funding than others, leading to a lack of diversity in scientific research.
* Limited public engagement: Traditional funding models often fail to engage the public in the research process, leading to a lack of public awareness and support for scientific research.
* OpenDenzent solves these problems by providing a decentralized platform that connects researchers and donors directly, without intermediaries, using blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and immutability of all transactions. It also provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easier for researchers to obtain the resources they need and for donors to contribute funds directly to the research projects they choose to support. 
## Roadmap
**Current MVP**
* Decentralized platform connecting researchers and donors directly: OpenDenzent's MVP would provide a decentralized platform that connects researchers and donors directly. Researchers can create accounts on the platform and create project listings for their research projects. Donors can also create accounts on the platform and browse through the project listings to find research projects they are interested in supporting. The platform would use blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and immutability of all transactions.
* Project listings: Researchers can create project listings on the platform, which would include details about the project's objectives, methodologies, and expected outcomes. Project listings would be publicly visible on the platform, allowing donors to browse through them and find research projects they are interested in supporting.
* Direct funding: Donors can contribute funds directly to the research projects they choose to support through the platform. The platform would provide a simple, user-friendly interface for donors to make contributions, and donors can choose to support the project with a one-time donation or a recurring donation.

**2023 Q3**
* Researcher profiles: Researchers can create profiles on the platform that showcase their past research projects, credentials, and ongoing research projects. This will enable donors to get to know the researchers better and make informed decisions about which projects to support.
* Transparent reporting: The MVP would require researchers to report regularly on the progress of their research projects. The reporting would be visible to donors, allowing them to track the progress of the research projects they have funded. This would ensure transparency in the funding process and enable donors to see the impact of their contributions.

**2023 Q4**
* Collaboration with academic institutions: OpenDenzent could collaborate with academic institutions to provide additional resources for researchers, such as access to laboratory equipment and facilities. This could also help to validate the research being conducted on the platform and enhance its credibility.
* Development of partnerships: OpenDenzent could develop partnerships with other organizations in the scientific research community, such as scientific journals or other funding agencies. This would enable researchers to access additional resources and funding opportunities, further enhancing the value of the platform

**2024 Q1**
* We‚Äôll start building the OpenDenzent Mobile App for both iOS and Android.
* We have aim to have 1000+ research listings on our platform.
